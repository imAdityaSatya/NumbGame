# NumberGame
It is number guessing game.
Your computer has chosen a random number between 1 and 100 and now its your turn to guess that. 
As a clue, on each wrong guess you'll be told whether your guess is greater or lesser than the actual number which the computer has chosen.
Let's see how many guesses you take to finally reach the correct number. 

Rules for SCORE:-
So you will a zero only in case you took more than 10 guesses(or attempts)
If you take 8 to 10 guesses to win, then you score 50
Similarly you score 75 for taking 5 to 7 guesses to win   
And if you manage to win in just 1 or 2 or 3 guesses, well then you score a perfect 100

Guesses     Score
above 10     0
8 to 10      50
4 to 7       75
1 to 3       100

Hope you enjoy my work :)
